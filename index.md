## Deep Learning 

### Reconstructing Medical Images

<div style="text-align: justify"> Medical imaging data sets are often imbalanced as pathologic findings are  generally rare, which introduce significant challenges when training deep learning models, but using deep learning can help. Deep learning is so adept at image work that some AI scientists are using neural networks to create medical images, not just read them. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify"> Generative models like Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder and GAN use patterns learned from real scans to create synthetic versions of CT or MRI images.  The data can be randomly generated and endlessly diverse, allowing researchers to access large volumes of necessary data without any concerns around patient privacy or consent.Such a strategy could significantly reduce of enough data.  In this project I have implemented autoencoder with skip connection for skin lesion image generation.</div>

### Variational Autoencoder Performance Analysis

This is my complete implementation of Variational Autoenocder (VAE) and the impact of hyperparameter tuning on VAE performance using MNIST and CelebA dataset

**MNIST:** The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning ([GitHub](https://github.com/ShrideviReddy/Evaluating-VAE)).

**CelebA Dataset:** CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter. ([GitHub](https://github.com/ShrideviReddy/Evaluating-VAE)).

### Fighting Adversarial attacks

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/ShrideviReddy/Secure-ML)

<div style="text-align: justify">Adversarial attacks are major threats to machine learning models. Machine learning models can be easily fooled even with simple attacks like FGSM. In this project I have implemented different research papers about adversarial attacks and defenses against them. This project also has a collection of different state of the art research papers. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> After processing the dataset and building a model to predict breast cancer, I built an interactive user interface with Flask and hosted the web application on Heroku server.</div>
