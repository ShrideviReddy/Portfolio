## Deep Learning

### Variational Autoencoder Performance Analysis

This is my complete implementation of Variational Autoenocder (VAE) and the impact of hyperparameter tuning on VAE performance using MNIST and CelebA dataset

**MNIST:** An NMT system which translates texts from Spanish to English using a Bidirectional LSTM encoder for the source sentence and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder with multiplicative attention for the target sentence ([GitHub](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Solutions/tree/master/assignments/)).

**CelebA Dataset:** A Neural Transition-Based Dependency Parsing system with one-layer MLP ([GitHub](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/CS224n-NLP-Assignments/tree/master/assignments/a3)).

### Fighting Adversarial attacks

<div style="text-align: justify">Adversarial attacks are major threats to machine learning models. Machine learning models can be easily fooled even with simple attacks like FGSM. In this project I have implemented different research papers about adversarial attacks and defenses against them. This project also has a collection of different state of the art research papers. </div>
